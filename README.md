# Quiz Game
## Project Description
This is a small project that I attempted in the C programming language. I have created a quiz game that requires the participants to enter a valid digit and checked against an answer. The total is recorded and revealed to the user at the end of the five questions.  

## How To Run Project 
Typing 'make' into the terminal should compile all the necessary files. 
Then enter ./quiz to run the program.
